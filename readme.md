# Waffle 

Waffle is a lightweight C library for mathematical operations and data structures, designed for high performance and ease of use in scientific computing and graphics applications.

It is not intended for perfect accuracy in mathematical computations, but rather for speed and efficiency in scenarios where approximate results are acceptable.

Note that each function comes with a markdown file explaining the approximation methods used and their potential limitations.
